**About Project**

Tourism Management System is based on a concept of maintaining tour packages for the tourists. Before stepping into the main system a user has to pass through login system to get access, then only he/she can use the features of the system which includes booking package, previewing ticket, canceling a ticket, viewing tourism brochure. It also contains a sign-up feature.

Talking about the features of Tourism management system, a user needs a certain id to get access. For this, the user can simply sign up by providing username and password. After logging in as a user, there are several options to perform. The user can check for holiday packages and book. In order to book a package, the user has to select within given package details and enter the number of people. After the booking is done, he/she can check for the ticket details which displays the total price and ticket of the package. In total there are 10-holiday packages. Whenever the user wants to cancel the tickets, he/she can easily cancel it and get the refund.
